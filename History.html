    <h1>Below is our History:</h1>
    <p>Founded in the year 2000 by the late Mrs. Mary W. Mburu, the School started from humble beginnings as a Christian
    private school, mixed day and boarding with 19 pupils i.e. 18 in primary section and 1 in kindergarten section. The
    pioneer class did their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in the year 2002 and scored a mean grade of 362.
    The school progressed in size and performance for example in 2006 the school mean grade shot to 370 with the first
    candidate being 2nd in the former central region.
    
    JSPS has consistently produced the top candidates in Thika West every year in national examinations. This is a
    manifestation of the quality of teaching staff, a dedicated administration and the exceptional pupils joining the school
    each year. The school offers the 8-4- 4 curriculum which emphasizes on a holistic preparation of a pupil.
    
    To-date the school has moved a niche higher due to success and demand; we have expanded opportunities to have a
    full-fledged kindergarten solely running by itself separate from the primary section.
